<!-- OVERVIEW -->

## Overview

- Where can I see your demo?
https://css-slider-radio-buttons.vercel.app/

- First ever challenge on 100daysCSS and I found it quite helpful. The hardest bit of the challenge for me was getting the images to change when you click on a radio button.
- I feel more comfortable with styling radio buttons and creating image sliders.
